          <p>Expert comment: ThL 5000 is the new entry to the list and comes with a massive 5,000 battery and respectable specs all around. For an entry-level price, with the ThL 5000, you get decent camera performance, a full-HD display, which is unheard of in this price range, and good built-in storage. There are very few phones in this category that can compete with these kind of specs. Fair to say, ThL 5000 is one of the easiest phones to recommend at this price point. </p>

         <p>Expert comment: After the hike in GST rates in April 2020, we were all worried for a while whether great value for money phones from Xiaomi and Realme will ever be available at as good prices as they were available earlier. Redmi 9A is a proof that those days are just around the corner again. The phone comes with modern aesthetics, decent processor, and a massive battery life to offer a decent deal for the price. While you will have to make some compromises in display and camera quality, at this price point, it should be understandable</p>

         <p>Expert comment: For its price, Realme C11 is a phone that gets the job done. There is nothing fancy about the phone that one can boast about but a combination of decent processor, good battery life, and acceptable camera performance should be suitable for a lot of users. Apart from the utilitarian side, the phone has a really distinctive Rich Green colour option that sets it apart from other phones in the price segment. As Realme has already established its name in India over the last few years, even the brand recognition won't be an issue anymore.</p>

         <p>Expert comment:  The Redmi 8A Dual favours those looking for a reliable smartphone in the budget segment. The phone scores high on design and battery life, which are both crucial aspects for a lot of users out there. The handset is powered by Snapdragon 439 SoC that is capable of handling almost everything, from daily tasks to light games, you throw at it. The phone has a dual rear camera setup with a dedicated secondary lens for the bokeh effect. If you're tight on budget, we'd say the Redmi 8A makes a lot of sense.</p>

If you are looking for a specialist phone that excels in one particular category, Narzo 20A might not be the pick for you but if you are looking for a phone that tackles most tasks with ease, Narzo 20A might be a good choice to go with.</p>

        <p>Expert comment:    Redmi 9 Prime came like a breath of fresh air in the market that was disrupted by the price hikes due to change in GST rates in India. The handset is priced below Rs 10,000 but you get a quad camera setup, a really good processor, good battery life, and even fast charging support with the Redmi 9 Prime. While Xiaomi was losing its charm with the aggressive push from Realme and Samsung in last year, Redmi 9 Prime put the brand back in the driving position for this price segment.</p>

    <p>Expert comment:   Realme C15 enters the list with a whopping 6,000mAh battery and quad cameras at a budget price. The handset gets the basics right and then adds these two features at the top to make it an even sweeter deal. There is a capable chipset that handles most day to day tasks with ease and the brand has also included support for quick charging on the phone. If we consider the value for money aspect, C15 definitely earns its slot over here.</p>
