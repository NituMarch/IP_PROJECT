          <p>Expert comment:  The latest and the greatest iPhone from Apple comes with such horsepower that even PCs can start sweating at this point. Although everybody expected Apple to include some standout pathbreaking features with the new iPhones, the iPhone Pro Max was launched with key improvements across the board. The handset comes with an improved display, battery life, and even camera performance. There were several doubts raised last year over the brand's claims to be the best in optics but with iPhone Pro Max, Apple truly managed to deliver a knockout punch to the critics</p>

          <p>Expert comment:  Samsung's Galaxy S series flagship phone from 2020 comes with the high-end industry features, including a display with 120Hz refresh rate. As you might expect with Samsung's expertise in displays, the S20 Plus comes with one of the best panels ever seen on a smartphone. Along with this, you get the best chipset on any Android phone, a massive battery backup, extremely capable camera setup, and a punch-hole design. If you are going for an Android phone, you cannot go wrong with this one.</p>

          <p>Expert comment:  Probably the most popular iPhone model of recent times, the iPhone 11 doesn't dig as deep a hole in your pocket as some of the recent flagships from the brand have. The iPhone 11 comes with dual rear cameras and is one of the most capable camera smartphones available in the market. If you are not interested in clicking pictures, no worries, the handset ships with A13 Bionic chipset, which is the most powerful mobile chipset available in the industry right now. The phone offers a great battery life and a great display quality too. On the software side, the phone delivers like a true champ too</p>

          <p>Expert comment:  It should hardly come as a surprise that the latest and greatest phone from OnePlus actually makes this list. The brand has been growing quickly ever since its launch and its latest phone offers a high refresh rate display, top-of-the-line processor, premium design, and great software. There are many phones that feature great hardware but software usually bogs down the package but with OnePlus, you get the best software experience on an Android phone, barring Pixel handsets</p>

          <p>Expert comment:  Xiaomi's flagship handset comes with a modern design, 90Hz display refresh rate, and a flagship-grade processor. You also get good battery backup. However, the most impressive aspect about this phone is the camera department. The handset offers cameras that can take detailed pictures that can rival those taken from most other premium end smartphones. If you have used MIUI before, you'll feel right at home but with an even less intrusive interface.</p>

          <p>Expert comment:   Huawei P30 Pro turned out to be the unlikely contender that displaced iPhone XS Max from the top spot in this list. The new handset from Huawei comes with incredible features like 50x zoom, reverse charging, and excellent low-light imaging capabilities. Arguably the best-looking smartphone in the market, the P30 Pro comes with a quad-camera setup that allows it to produce pictures that can, at times, rival DSLR cameras as well. Huawei’s P30 Pro is the best Android handset to come in a very long time and offers good performance on all fronts</p>

          <p>Expert comment:  OnePlus has the habit of launching flagship-killer phones and although the brand is itself getting good competition off-late, there is no denying that its latest offering, i.e. OnePlus 7T, is one of the best handsets to launch in 2019. When you consider that OnePlus 7T comes with a 90Hz display, 30W fast charging, the top-of-the-line chipset, and a premium design, at a much lower price point than most flagships, you'll have to ponder over the thought of spending a premium for other handsets in the market and the additional value they bring along</p>

          <p>Expert comment: When a handset offers the top-of-the-line chipset available in the market for half the price of most flagships, there is little room left for nitpicking. Realme X2 Pro doesn't just feature a great processor but offers an extremely capable camera setup, headlined by a whopping 64MP camera sensor. The top features don't end here as the flagship from Realme comes with a 90Hz display, which provides a butter-smooth user experience. It won't be wrong to say that Realme has gained the reputation of new flagship killer in the market with Realme X2 Pro.</p>

As the name suggests, the handset offers great zooming functionality. You also get a premium design with the phone and a decent display. Even if you are not interested in camera performance, which is one of the strong aspects of this phone, this is still a great buy for an overall package</p>
